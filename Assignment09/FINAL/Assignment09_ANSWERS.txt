    Assignment: The purpose of this assignment is to experiment with the 
		behavior of transactions using a MariaDB database.You will 
		need to use more than one MariaDB session for these to work. 
		To do this, just open up two separate putty sessions to turing 
		or hopper and log into MariaDB on each of them.


Question 1.2) What is the result of running the SELECT statement. Why?
	      Results: Database Changed 
		       Empty set (0.000 sec) 

	      The reason why I got the result above was because we didn't
	      use the keyword "end transaction", "COMMIT", or "ROLLBACK." 
	      This cause the SELECT query to be be set to empty. 

Question 1.5) What is the result of the SELECT statement above?
	      Result: +----+-------+
		      | pk | data  |
		      +----+-------+
		      |  1 | dataA |
		      |  2 | dataB |
		      |  3 | dataC |
		      |  4 | dataD |
		      |  5 | dataE |
		      +----+-------+

Question 2.4) What is the result of the SELECT statement, and why?
	      Results: Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)

	      ERROR 1146 (42S02):Table 'z1861700.Spring' doesn't exist
		
	      The reason why I got the results above was because "Spring" 
	      doesn't exist in the database.

Question 2.5) What is the result of the SELECT statement, and why?	
	      Results: +----+-------+
		       | pk | data  |
		       +----+-------+
		       |  1 | dataA |
		       |  2 | dataB |
		       |  3 | dataC |
		       |  4 | dataD |
		       |  5 | dataE |
		       +----+-------+
	      The query above was created because even though we did an 
	      insertion and update the database when they keyword "ROLLBACK" 
	      is used it will roll back the changes and that is exacly what
	      we got.

		Part III: Be Aware of Deadlock (25pts)


Question 3) What happened here?
            What happen is our database went into a deadlock stage. It seemed like 
	    it was waiting for user input. This was cause due to having session I 
	    not being able to complete until session II would complete itself. And
	    session II would not be able to compelte itself until session I is done. 
	    That is the reason why our database went into deadlock.
